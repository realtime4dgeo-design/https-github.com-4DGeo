4DGeo Drone Delivery: Decentralized Geospatial Tracking with Customer Data Ownership
� � �
Overview
4DGeo Drone Delivery is an open-source platform that revolutionizes drone-based delivery services by integrating advanced 4D geospatial visualization with blockchain technology. Built on the foundation of the 4DGeo visualization toolkit, this project enables real-time tracking of drone flights, package handoffs, and environmental interactions in an interactive 4D dashboard.
What sets us apart? Decentralized information flow ensures transparency and security, while customer-owned data principles empower users to control their delivery history, location traces, and personal info via self-sovereign identity (SSI) protocols. No more centralized silos—your data, your rules.
Key Vision
Geospatial Precision: Visualize drone paths, altitude changes, and delivery zones in 4D (3D + time) using LiDAR-like point clouds and photogrammetry.
Decentralized Backbone: Blockchain (Ethereum-compatible) for immutable logs of flights, payments, and consents.
Customer Empowerment: Users own their data via IPFS storage and DID (Decentralized Identifiers), with zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving sharing.
Sustainability Focus: Optimize routes to minimize energy use, tracked via on-chain metrics.

Features
Interactive 4D Dashboard: Web-based UI for monitoring live drone swarms, historical replays, and predictive analytics. Supports AR/VR export.
Blockchain Integration:
Smart contracts for automated payments (e.g., crypto micropayments per km).
Event logging for every takeoff, waypoint, and delivery confirmation.
Decentralized oracles for real-world data feeds (weather, airspace regs).
Data Ownership Layer:
Customers generate DIDs to sign and store delivery metadata on IPFS.
Granular consent: Share only what's needed (e.g., ETA without full route).
Audit trails: Verify data integrity without revealing contents.
Drone Fleet Management: API hooks for popular drone SDKs (DJI, PX4). Simulate fleets in the dashboard.
Modular & Lightweight: Core app under 5MB; extend with plugins for custom sensors (e.g., thermal cams for package temp monitoring).
Privacy-First: End-to-end encryption; complies with GDPR/CCPA via Verifiable Credentials.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js v18+
Yarn or npm
MetaMask or similar wallet for blockchain interactions
Access to a drone simulator (e.g., Gazebo) for testing
Quick Setup (2 Minutes)
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/4dgeo-drone-delivery.git
cd 4dgeo-drone-delivery
Install dependencies:
yarn install
Set up environment:
Copy .env.example to .env and add your Infura/Alchemy API key, IPFS node, and wallet seed (use testnet!).
For data ownership demo: Generate a DID via uPort CLI.
Run the dev server:
yarn start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the dashboard.
Load sample data:
Import drone flight logs via the UI (CSV/JSON with timestamps).
Simulate a delivery: Use the built-in script scripts/simulate-delivery.js.
For production: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify for frontend; use Heroku or a VPS for backend. Blockchain deployment via Hardhat.
