Integrating Geo Flight Blockchain with ArcGIS for Live 4D Geo Mapping
The Geo Flight Blockchain package provides a robust foundation for decentralized 4D geospatial data (latitude, longitude, altitude, and timestamped flight paths) via its REST API endpoints (e.g., /register for new paths, /path/{id} for queries). This enables real-time visualization in ArcGIS as a time-enabled feature layer or stream layer for live 4D mapping, such as tracking predicted flight trajectories or NFT-minted paths on a 3D scene.
ArcGIS supports ingesting REST API data into hosted layers for dynamic updates. For live streaming, bridge the blockchain's HTTP API to an ArcGIS stream service using tools like ArcGIS Velocity or GeoEvent Server. Below is a step-by-step guide to create and deploy such a layer, assuming you've installed and run the blockchain node (e.g., ./build/src/main --config config.toml exposes the API at http://localhost:8080).
Prerequisites
ArcGIS Pro 3.2+ or ArcGIS Online account.
Running Geo Flight node with API enabled (set api.http_port = 8080 in config.toml).
Python 3.10+ with arcgis library (pip install arcgis).
For streaming: ArcGIS Enterprise with GeoEvent Server or Velocity (optional but recommended for sub-second updates).
Data format: Flight paths from the API return GeoJSON-like objects with 4D points (e.g., {"path": [{"lat": 40.7128, "lon": -74.0060, "alt": 1000, "time": 1730000000}], "velocity": 200}).
Step 1: Prepare Blockchain Data for ArcGIS
The blockchain's geospatial module outputs 4D points (using geopoint.h and path_predictor.cpp for Arc-based predictions). Poll the API to fetch live data.
Test API Access:
Query a path: curl http://localhost:8080/path/123 (returns JSON with timestamped points).
Register a sample path (mints NFT): Use the curl example from INSTALL.md.
Create a Polling Script (Python, using ArcGIS API for Python): Save this as poll_blockchain_to_features.py and run it periodically (e.g., via cron every 10s for near-live updates).
from arcgis.gis import GIS
from arcgis.features import FeatureLayer
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to ArcGIS Online (or Enterprise)
gis = GIS("https://www.arcgis.com", "your_username", "your_password")

# Blockchain API endpoint
api_url = "http://localhost:8080"  # Update to your node's IP/port

# Fetch live flight paths (adapt query as needed, e.g., /paths?since=1730000000)
response = requests.get(f"{api_url}/paths")  # Assume endpoint for all recent paths
data = response.json()

# Transform to GeoJSON features with time (4D: lat/lon/alt/time)
features = []
for path in data['paths']:
    for point in path['path']:
        feature = {
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "spatialReference": {"wkid": 4326},  # WGS84
                "x": point['lon'], "y": point['lat'], "z": point['alt']
            },
            "attributes": {
                "ObjectID": len(features) + 1,
                "PathID": path['id'],
                "Velocity": path.get('velocity', 0),
                "Timestamp": datetime.fromtimestamp(point['time']).isoformat(),  # Time-enabled
                "NFT_Token": path.get('token_id', None)
            }
        }
        features.append(feature)

# Update or create hosted feature layer
item = gis.content.get("your_live_flight_layer_id")  # Or create new: gis.content.create_item(...)
layer = item.layers[0]
layer.edit_features(adds=features)  # Append new points

print(f"Updated layer with {len(features)} 4D points from blockchain.")
Run: python poll_blockchain_to_features.py.
This creates/updates a feature collection with time attributes for 4D playback.
Step 2: Create the Layer in ArcGIS Pro
Use a time-enabled feature layer for 4D visualization (supports lat/lon/alt/time). For true live streaming, convert to a stream layer.
Add Data as Feature Layer:
Open ArcGIS Pro > New Map (or Scene for 3D).
Insert > Add Data > From Path: Use a local GeoJSON export from your script (e.g., features.geojson).
Or connect directly via REST: Catalog > Portal > Add the hosted layer from Step 1.
Enable Time and Multidimensional:
Right-click layer > Properties > Time tab:
Enable time.
Set Layer Time to Timestamp field (Date type).
Time Extent: Rolling (e.g., last 1 hour) for live view.
For 4D (multidimensional): Properties > Multidimensional tab:
Enable multidimensional data.
Variables: e.g., Altitude (Z-dim), Timestamp (time dim).
This allows slicing by time/altitude for path predictions.
Symbolize: Symbology > Graduated colors by velocity; extrude by altitude for 3D flights.
Visualize Live 4D:
Switch to Scene view for 3D.
View tab > Time > Enable slider to animate paths.
For predictions: Use path_predictor.cpp outputs (via API) as trajectory lines.
Option: Create a Stream Layer for Real-Time Updates
The blockchain API isn't a native stream service, so bridge it:
Set Up Stream Service (Requires ArcGIS Enterprise):
In GeoEvent Server/Velocity: Create an HTTP Receiver connector to poll your blockchain API (e.g., every 5s).
Define event schema: GeoPoint with attributes (PathID, Velocity, Timestamp).
Output to a Stream Service (REST endpoint like https://your-enterprise/arcgis/rest/services/LiveFlights/StreamServer).
Add to ArcGIS Pro/Online:
Map tab > Layer > Add Layer > From URL: Enter the StreamServer REST endpoint.
Configure: Enable time on Timestamp; set purge options (e.g., keep last 100 events).
The layer auto-updates with new blockchain events (e.g., registered flights).
Publish to ArcGIS Online:
Right-click layer > Share > Web Layer > Hosted Feature Layer (or Stream Layer).
In ArcGIS Online: Content > Add to new Map/Scene > Enable Time Slider for 4D animation.
Step 3: Deploy for Web/Live Mapping
ArcGIS Online Dashboard:
Upload the hosted layer > Map Viewer > Add layer > Configure pop-ups (e.g., show NFT token, predicted path).
Embed in apps: Use ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript with esri/layers/StreamLayer pointing to your stream endpoint.
Automation for Production:
Schedule the Python script in ArcGIS Notebooks or Lambda.
For blockchain mainnet: Update api_url in script to a load-balanced node endpoint.
Security: Add API keys in config.toml under [api]; use CORS for web apps.
Example Visualization
3D Scene: Flight paths as animated lines (time slider scrubs through epochs), colored by staking validators.
Query Example: Filter layer by min_stake > 1000 to show validated paths only.
Performance: For high-volume (e.g., 1000+ flights), use indexed queries in the API and layer clustering.
Troubleshooting
No Updates: Verify API response (e.g., curl http://localhost:8080/health). Check script logs.
Time Sync: Ensure timestamps in UNIX format convert correctly to ISO.
3D Rendering: If alt=0, set default elevation in layer properties.
Custom Endpoints: Extend api_server.cpp for /streams WebSocket if needed for sub-second live feeds.
This setup turns your Geo Flight node into a live 4D data oracle for ArcGIS, enabling decentralized mapping of flight NFTs and predictions. For Koop.js to directly proxy the API as an ArcGIS service, see the video guide. If you need the polling script customized or help with GeoEvent setup, provide more details!
